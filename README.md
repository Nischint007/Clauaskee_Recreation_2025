🌀 GSAP – Animation Engine
Used GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to create smooth and sequenced animations triggered by scroll. All text entrances, image reveals, and transitions are timed using GSAP for a polished, studio-level feel.

🧭 Lenis.js – Smooth Scrolling
Lenis.js was used to replace native scroll with a smoother, inertia-based experience. It enhances scroll timing and syncs perfectly with GSAP's ScrollTrigger, giving the site a premium interaction feel.

🖱 Shery.js – Custom Cursor & Hover Effects
Shery.js powers the custom magnetic mouse follower and interactive hover effects on navbar and buttons. It adds subtle distortion, scaling, and attention-grabbing feedback when interacting with key elements.
